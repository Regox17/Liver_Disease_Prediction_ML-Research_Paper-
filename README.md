# Liver Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms for predicting liver disease using the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD). We compare traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM with ensemble models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

## 🧪 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Sensitivity (Recall)
- Specificity
- ROC-AUC
